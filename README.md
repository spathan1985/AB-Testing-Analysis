# Optimizing Player Retention: An A/B Test Analysis of Progression Gates in Mobile Gaming

**TL;DR: Retention Analysis & Recommendation**

**The Goal:** Test if moving the first "gate" in Cookie Cats from Level 30 to Level 40 improves player retention.

**The Finding:** Moving the gate to Level 40 decreased 7-day retention by 0.82%. While this sounds small, bootstrapping simulations show a 99.8% probability that this decrease is real and not due to random chance.

**The Recommendation:** Do not roll out the Level 40 gate. Stick with the Level 30 gate to maximize long-term player engagement and lifetime value (LTV).
